        Make long click to select file and open context menu with available actions.<br>
        This is how context menu looks like for single selected file. If more than one file will be selected
        will be removed all operations which applicable for single file only (such as <strong>Edit</strong>, <strong>Rename</strong> etc). The same actual for directories. But even for
        single selected directory option <strong>Edit</strong> will not be available.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Info</strong> option is used for getting essential information (such as size, last modification date, permissions etc)
        for selected (single) file/directory.
        <br>
        As you can probably guess, <strong>Send</strong> option is used to send file to another application (most commonly used for social sharing).
        <br>
        Use <strong>Open with</strong> option when you want to select application which will open currently selected file.
        When there is no applications to open selected file you will see error message in chooser dialog (<font color="red">No application can be found to open this file</font>).
        But also you are able to manually select application to open current file. To see list of all available applications click on <strong>Show all</strong>
        label in chooser dialog.
        <br>
        On this dialog you can find <strong>Open As</strong>. Use this option to select mime type to find applications for opening currently selected file.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Create Archive</strong> option is used for creating archive from selected files (read more in <a href="far_help/archives">Archives</a>).
